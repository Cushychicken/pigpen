# pigpen

Pigpen is an HTTP Gateway to Hardware Interfaces on a Raspberry Pi. It's an easy way to talk to GPIO, sensors, peripheral devices like Bluetooth radios or cellular modems, buses, memory chips, and much more. 

It's a great way to interact with your low level hardware thru a browser client, a Python CLI, or `curl` calls.

# Who's this for?

Primarily, me: Nash Reilly, aka @cushychicken. I wanted a way to boop around with sensors and arbitrary sensors without recalling a bunch of boilerplate Python code.

Plus: I kind of want a GUI for this. I don't really know why. I just think they're neat.
